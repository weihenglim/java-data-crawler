text:	I used to have existential fears of bitcoin's demise. Now it's all price action. Bitcoin is here to stay... It's got its claws into the big system. I also used to say "0 or 10,000". With 11,000 holding strong, I'm trying to come up with a new paradigmatic explanation... Perhaps "10,000 or 1,000,000"? Seems crazy, but it's hard to explain how crazy 10,000 seemed about 6 years ago.}

I think weekends are no longer influenced by waves of retail fish and/or natural demand - they are driven entirely by whales hunting stops. It is way too easy for these guys to throw the price around when there is very low liquidity, and too much incentive to do so with bitmex. 

But I‚Äôve noticed this power is significantly diminished during the trading week. This is actually a really good thing - it‚Äôs a sign of the asset becoming more deeply rooted in the global financial system (in the way gold is) and being held by professional strong hands with lots of money and patience. As liquidity continues to grow (which I expect it to), the weekend volatility should shrink over time, along with bitmex‚Äôs influence.

I actually expect to see weekend and overnight gapped charts in the not too distant future. This market is just too insane for big money players to watch.

Peace and good luck to you gents ‚úåÔ∏è}

text:	I'm bullish. Nice hidden bull divs on the 4hr, will be valid unless we get under 10.8k but I just can't see it happening. Dumps have been hard to come by recently, this is just some healthy consolidation after our run from 9.5k-12k.

&amp;#x200B;

On the daily we topped out around 12k, which was a perfect level to stop as it just prevented us painting a huge hidden bear div on the daily, any higher and it would have been ugly. Some might disagree with me but I do not think this is a coincidence.

Lower timeframes don't look great so probably more chop to come but I think we'll be getting out of this over the next week hopefully.}

‚Ä¢ a handful of entities seem to exercise the ability to manipulate the price of BTC
‚Ä¢ random world events may alter the price of BTC, e.g. Trump tweets 
It seems that it‚Äôs a futile effort to attempt to predict what is otherwise seemingly unpredictable (point 2) or manipulatable.

{ score:	-15
text:	As I see it. Some indicators are pointing to a target for a correction to around 8-9k. But for a correction to actaully play out people have to dump in droves. It may be that it is not worth the hassle (and risk) for market makers and whales to push the price to such a low for a mere 30% gain (if optimally executed). There is much more to gain by slowly accumulating coins and boiling the frogs/bears.

We'll know soon.

Is there a way on BitMex to put in a limit buy/sell and have an automatic sell/buy that triggers if the original order is hit?

Like for example, if I have a limit buy at 11000, and the price hits 11000 but not my order, which messes things up}

text:	Hi Guys, please bear with me, I am still in the process of learning.

If you hedge (that is what I think it is called )  25% of your trading stack at the top before it drops.  Meaning, you sell 25% before it drops.  Will this be substantial in protecting your long or does it all depend on how far it drops. ( Obviously, I guess)   I'm trying to figure out how much of my stack to sell before or at  a drop to protect a long.  How do you guys calculate it or gauge it?  Or is the best strategy to maybe just straddle?  Using our most recent dip as an example.  Assuming you can perfectly time the bottom of the dip again to buy back in what you sold.  I am really just for now applying trial and error but feel like I have no Idea what Im doing. hahahah}
